[FreeCodeCamp: Responsive Web Design Certification] - Project: Product Landing Page

# Summary
Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Product Landing Page
In this project, I was tasked with creating a product landing page. I decided to use a real business to practice. This 
business is a Hair Salon that my Aunt runs in Mexicali, Baja California. Her Salon is in Mexico so I had to make the entire website
in Spanish as it was a business in Mexico.
